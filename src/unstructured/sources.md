# Sources as a Concurrency Primitive

With [async functions](../basic/using_async.md), [active Futures](../basic/futures.md) and [channels](../basic/channels.md)
we should be able to write our program, and make them easily reasonable with [structured concurrency](../basic/structured_concurrency.md).

However, often we use concurrency to deal with asynchronous external events, such as file I/O, networking, sockets, ...
From the program's point of view, this is completely _unstructured_: often you ask for an operation, and at some point in the
future (out of our control), we get back a response.
This does not mix well with our current concepts, where callers _always_ manage its own execution flow and structure.

![Unstructured concurrency!](../images/unstructured.png)

To deal with such asynchronous events, Gears provide some interfaces to be used as bridges between the unstructured world and
structured concurrency programs.
These come in the forms of [**`Async.Source`**](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html)s.

## Callbacks and push

The most basic concept of requesting an asynchronous operation is through a *callback*.

Let's illustrate this through a very simple example, of reading a file.

```scala
object File:
  def readString(path: String)(callback: Either[Error, String] => Unit): Cancellable
```

Suppose we have a non-blocking API of reading a file at `path`. The content of the file will be read into a `String`, which
is passed into `callback` (or, if errors come up, they also get passed into `callback`).
Rather than the operation result, `readString`'s caller receives a *request* object, which has a `cancel` method to attempt
to cancel the read operation.

![Flow of callback](../images/flow_callback.png)

The flow of callback-based operations is as follows:
1. `body` calls `File.readString(path)(callback)`, getting back a `Cancellable` *immediately*.
2. `body` does *not* control when or how `callback` is called, and has no provided way to interact with `callback`.

   In reality, should `body` want to _wait_ for `callback`'s result, it can either
   - Put all handling logic past `readString` into `callback`, turning `callback` into a *full continuation*.
   - Introduce blocking/suspending through some synchronization primitive (channel, mutex).

   Without `Async` the latter option introduces _blocking_ code, which effectively nullifies the advantage of using non-blocking
   API in the first place. Therefore, traditional languages with callbacks (Node.js is an infamous example) chose the former,
   creating the problem of _callback hell_.
3. At some time in the future, `callback` is called with the result. This might happen while `body` is still executing,
   or after. Depending on parallelism capabilities, it may be executed in parallel to `body`.

### How `Async` makes callbacks easier

In Gears however, we have `Async` computations: computations that can _suspend_ to wait for a future value! This means,
given the same API, we can do the following:
- _Suspend_ the current `Async` context
- Issue the asynchronous request, passing the _resumption_ of the `Async` context as the callback.

![Flow of callback with Async](../images/flow_callback_async.png)

And, in essence, this is exactly what [`Async.await`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async.html#) does!

Let's have a now fully-expanded signature of `Async.await`:
```scala
trait Async:
  def await[T](src: Source[T]): T
```

With our knowledge of the Async-callback flow, we know that `src` would be some callback-taking future value.
`Async.await` would then do the suspend / set-resume-callback procedure, and return the output of the `src` as if we continued
from within the callback.

This suspension/resume mechanism is how `Async` was able to let you await for concurrent `Future`s (which is also a `Source`!)
without being inside a `Future` itself, monadic style.

## The `Source` trait

Now that we have an idea of what a `Source` is, we can now look at how
[`Source`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html) is defined:
```scala
trait Source[+T]:
  def onComplete(listener: Listener[T]): Unit

  def poll(listener: Listener[T]): Boolean
  def poll(): Option[T]

  def dropListener(listener: Listener[T]): Unit

  inline def awaitResult(using Async): T = Async.await(this)

// Included for convenience, simplified...
trait Listener[-T]:
  def complete(item: T, origin: Source[T]): Unit
```

- [`onComplete`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html#onComplete-fbc)
does exactly what you expect: when an item is available, `listener` is called with the item.
`listener` also gets a reference to the `Source` itself, in case it was passed to multiple `Source`s and
needs to distinguish *which* source the item came from.
- [`poll(listener)`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html#) works as a non-blocking poll:
  if an item is immediately available, call the `listener` with it immediately.
  Otherwise, immediately return `false`, and usually this means you'd want to put your listener into `onComplete` instead.

  If an item is all you need, [`poll()`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html#poll-fffff63d)
  is a much more convenient overload: you just get the item back, or `None` if it was not immediately available.
- [`dropListener`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/Async$$Source.html#) signals that `listener` is no longer
  needed to be called. This usually signals the cancellation of the value receiver.

  Note that this is _not_ cancelling the `Source` itself: `Source` does not have a concept of cancellation!
  Not all asynchronous operations are cancellable.

Finally, `awaitResult` is just a convenience postfix method for `Async.await`.
In special cases where `T` is `Either` or `Try` (`Future[T]` is a `Source[Try[T]]`), we have `.await` as a convenience
postfix method that also unwraps the value!

## Persistent and Ephemeral Sources

So far, things seem clear when we have one `Source` and one `Listener`.
What happens when we pass multiple listeners into a `Source`?

The answer depends a lot on _what_ the source is representing:
- Should we write the above `readString` function in terms of `Source` instead:
  ```scala
  object File:
    def readString(path: String): Source[Either[Error, String]] & Cancellable
  ```
  then the `Source` returned represents a single _asynchronous request_. This request returns once, so no matter
  how many listeners are attached to it, they should get _the same value_ every time.

  We call Sources where all listeners get the same value, resolved at the same time[^time-is-hard], a **persistent source**.
  Especially, if a source is both persistent and cancellable, it is a `Future`.
  We shall see the "real" interface of a `Future` in the next section.
  ```scala
  // "correct" definition
  object File:
    def readString(path: String): Future[Either[Error, String]]
  ```
- Suppose we want to capture signals sent to our program. We might use a signal handler like this
  ```scala
  object Signals:
    def capture(signals: Signal*): Source[Signal]
  ```
  in which our `Source` represents a _subscription_ to the system process' signal handler. This will
  deliver multiple signals to our program, and each listener attached to this `Source` should get *one*,
  *possibly different* signal.
  We call Sources that deliver possibly different values to listeners an **ephemeral source**.

  Another example of an ephemeral source is
  [`.readSource`](https://lampepfl.github.io/gears/api/gears/async/ReadableChannel.html#readSource-0) of a channel.

## Active and Reactive Sources

Activeness and Reactivity of Sources refer to whether values are resolved to the Source regardless of
interactions with it (regarding adding/removing listeners).

Some sources, like an active `Future` or an asynchronous request like `File.readString`, will complete and
resolve with a value regardless of a listener attached to it or not.

Some other sources, like `Channel.readSource`, does not do anything on creation. It only attempts to
consume a value from the channel when a listener is attached to it.

From the perspective of the `Source`, this matters when one decides to create a `Source` but not await for it.
There is no way to differentiate the two sources from the signature alone, hence this should be an anti-pattern.

[^time-is-hard]: it is hard to say that concurrent listeners are resolved "at the same time".
We usually reason about this in terms of subsequent listeners: if one listener is attached to a persistent `Source`
_after_ another has been resolved, the second listener should be resolved immediately with the same value.
Consequently, `poll`ing this `Source` will always give the same value back immediately.
